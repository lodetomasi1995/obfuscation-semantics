CRITICAL: Return ONLY the Python code with no introduction or explanation.
Your response must start directly with 'def' and contain only valid Python code.

Apply these obfuscation techniques while maintaining EXACT functionality:

1. Function Transformation:
   - Rename '{function_name}' to '{obfuscated_name}'
   - Update recursive calls to use new name
   - Break the function into nested helpers if appropriate

2. Variable Obfuscation:
   - Use less intuitive but still valid names
   - Add a few unused variables
   - Use similar-looking characters (I, l, O, 0, 1) for confusion

3. Control Flow Obfuscation (moderate):
   - Use ternary expressions instead of simple if/else where appropriate
   - Add easily predictable conditions
   - Convert loops to recursive calls or vice versa if suitable

4. Mathematical Transformations (simple):
   - Split operations into multiple steps
   - Use equivalent but slightly more complex expressions
   - Add redundant calculations that cancel out

5. Dead Code (only 1-2):
   - Add some unused variables
   - Add one unused helper function
   - Include minimal dead code that doesn't impact execution flow

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Code MUST be syntactically valid Python
- The function MUST return the EXACT same result for all inputs
- Parameter names must stay the same
- Keep it simple - focus on correctness over complexity
