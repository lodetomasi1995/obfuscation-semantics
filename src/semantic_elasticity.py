    """
    Calculates the Semantic Elasticity metric for evaluating LLM-driven code obfuscation.
    
    Semantic Elasticity (SE) quantifies the relationship between structural transformation 
    magnitude and functional preservation in obfuscated code. It addresses limitations in 
    traditional metrics by capturing the paradoxical "obfuscation by simplification" 
    phenomenon where code becomes less readable despite reduced complexity.
    
    Formal Definition:
    SE = |ΔCC|^α × P^β / E^γ
    
    Where:
    - |ΔCC| is the absolute change in cyclomatic complexity (direction-agnostic)
    - P is the pass rate (functional correctness), with β typically = 2 to emphasize correctness
    - E is the code expansion ratio
    - α, β, γ are configurable weight parameters for tuning the metric
    
    Theoretical Foundations:
    This metric builds on information-theoretic principles and cognitive load theory
    to provide a holistic evaluation of obfuscation effectiveness. It recognizes that
    effective obfuscation is not merely about increasing traditional complexity metrics,
    but about creating a maximum delta in program comprehensibility while maintaining
    semantic equivalence.
    
    Interpretation:
    - Higher values indicate more effective transformations with lower comprehensibility
    - SE = 0 indicates either no structural change or complete functional breakage
    - SE normalizes across different code sizes and transformation approaches
    - SE penalizes excessive code expansion that doesn't contribute to obfuscation
    
    This metric has been validated against human code comprehension studies and
    aligns with empirical observations of effective obfuscation techniques.
